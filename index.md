## The Gospels and Other Writings

If the church of early days found the Hebrew scriptures in their Greek dress to be such an effective Bible, why was it felt necessary to augment them with what later came to be called the New Testament writings? - F.F. Bruce

### What does Canon even mean?

The root word means “Reed” a reed which could be used as a measuring rod

So the nature of the texts requires authority, as it will be used for guiding believers through time

_Ignatius, bishop of Antioch (c 110), refers to some people who refuse to believe anything that is not recorded ‘in the archives’ (or ‘in the charters’, meaning presumably the Old Testament scriptures), even if it is affirmed ‘in the gospel’. When Ignatius replied ‘It is written’ or ‘scripture says’ (presumably meaning a gospel writing), they retort, ‘That is the question’ - in other words, ‘Is the gospel scripture?’Ignatius responds with a rhetorical outburst, in which he affirms that his ultimate authority is Jesus Christ: whatever authority the ‘archives’ (or ‘charters’) have is summed up and brought to perfection in his passion and resurrection - in short, in the Christian faith._ - F.F. Bruce

AUTHORITY PRECEDES CANONICITY

### What are the gospels

- Before the term ‘gospel’ came to be given to any single one of the many other works of the same literary genre), it meant (1) the good news of the kingdom of preached by Jesus, (2) the good news about Jesus preached by his followers after the first Easter and Pentecost, (3) the written record of the good news current in a particular locality, (4) the fourfold gospel. - F.F. Bruce

**Matthew**
- Therefore Matthew put the oracles in an ordered arrangement in the Hebrew language, but each person interpreted them as best he could. - _Papias_

**Mark**
- _The Elder used to say: Mark, in his capacity as Peter’s interpreter, wrote down accurately as many things as he recalled from memory—though not in an ordered form of the things either said or done by the Lord. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied him, but later, as I said, Peter, who used to give his teachings in the form of but had no intention of providing an ordered arrangement of the logia of the Lord. Consequently Mark did nothing wrong when he wrote down some individual items just as he related them from memory. For he made it his one concern not to omit anything he had heard or to falsify anything._ - Papias

**Luke**
- _Marcion’s Gospel was an edition of the Gospel of Luke. Why he chould have chosen Luke’s gospel is a matter of speculation: perhaps in his native environment it had already come to be associated in a special way with Paul._ - F.F. Bruce

**John**
- _The earliest known quotation from John comes in the gnostic writer Basilides (c. 130); the earliest known commentary on John was written by the gnostic Heracleion (c.180). But those, like Justin Martyr, who read it more carefully found that it supplied more effective anti-gnostic ammunition than any other New Testament book._ - F.F. Bruce

### Seems very conservative of you to assume only the four were popular. How do you know there weren't more going around?
- I am not saying there weren't. 
- I am saying that the overwhelming evidence suggests that the early Christians only recognized four.

- Irenaeus of Lyon, born in the early second century, writing in the late second century from the region known today as France: _“There are four Gospels and only four, neither more nor less. … Christ is at the center of them. John actually speaks of his kingly and glorious sonship to the Father in his opening words: ‘In the beginning was the Word.’ Luke begins with Zechariah offering a sacrifice. Matthew chooses first of all the Lord’s human genealogy. And Mark leads off by calling on the prophetic Spirit which invests humanity from on high. …Matthew issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own language,* while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome, and laying the foundations of the Church. After their departure, Mark, Peter’s follower and translator, handed down to us in writing what had been preached by Peter. Luke also, the companion of Paul, recorded in a book the Gospel preached by him. Afterwards, John, the disciple of the Lord, who also had leaned on his chest, published a Gospel during his residence at Ephesus in Asia.” _
- Irenaeus probably gained at least some of his information through Polycarp of Smyrna, who was born in the first century and martyred in the mid-second century. Polycarp had been a companion of Papias; both Polycarp and Papias knew John the disciple of Jesus.

- Following Justin Martyr's martyrdom in 165, his disciple Tatian went back to his native Assyria, and there introduced what was to be for centuries a very influential edition of the gospels, his _Diatessaron_. This word is a musical term, meaning 'harmony of four'; it indicates clearly what this edition was. It was a continuous gospel narrative, produced by unstitching the units of the four individual gospels and restiching them together in what was taken to be their chronological order. The gospel of John provided the framework into which material from the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke was fitted. 

### You keep mentioning Papais. Who the heck was Papias?

![alt text](https://credomag.com/wp-content/uploads/bb-plugin/cache/papias-panorama.jpg)

- Papias was a Greek Apostolic Father, Bishop of Hierapolis (modern Pamukkale, Turkey), and author who lived c. 60 – c. 130 AD
- His goal was to gather oral traditions from original sources in order to preserve them. 
- Papias provides the earliest extant account of who wrote the Gospels.
- _I shall not hesitate also to put into ordered form for you, along with the interpretations, everything I learned carefully in the past from the elders and noted down carefully, for the truth of which I vouch. For unlike most people I took no pleasure in those who told many different stories, but only in those who taught the truth. Nor did I take pleasure in those who reported their memory of someone else’s commandments, but only in those who reported their memory of the commandments given by the Lord to the faith and proceeding from the Truth itself. And if by chance anyone who had been in attendance on the elders arrived, I made enquiries about the words of the elders—what Andrew or Peter had said, or Philip or Thomas or James or John or Matthew or any other of the Lord’s disciples, and whatever Aristion and John the Elder, the Lord’s disciples, were saying. For I did not think that information from the books would profit me as much as information from a living and surviving voice._
