*Such, then, is their system, which neither the [prophets](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm) announced, nor the Lord taught, nor the [apostles](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm) delivered, but of which they boast that beyond all others they have a perfect [knowledge](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08673a.htm). They gather their views from other sources than the [Scriptures](https://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html); and, to use a common proverb, they strive to weave ropes of sand, while they endeavour to adapt with an air of probability to their own peculiar assertions the [parables](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm) of the Lord, the sayings of the [prophets](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12477a.htm), and the words of the [apostles](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm), in order that their scheme may not seem altogether without support. In doing so, however, they disregard the order and the connection of the [Scriptures](https://www.newadvent.org/bible/index.html), and so far as in them lies, dismember and destroy the [truth]* - Irenaeus,

**St. Irenaeus**
 - 130-202
 - Born in Smyrna
 - Wrote "Against Heresies"

**Most likely, Irenaeus encountered Gnostics when he traveled to Rome, which at that time had a population of over a million people from all over the known world. He was particularly acquainted with a group known as Valentinians, who were part of the widespread phenomena we today refer to as Gnosticism. Irenaeus took time to study Gnostic writings and to talk to Gnostics in person. His conclusions, however, were firm and unequivocal: These people were wolves in sheep’s clothing, and their statements were “absurd and inconsistent with the truth.”*

*At the encouragement of a friend, Irenaeus wrote his reflections in a series of five books, which he titled  _The Refutation and Overthrowal of Knowledge Falsely So-Called_ (today known as  _Against Heresies_), a project he continued for a number of years, between A.D. 175 and 189.**

*Irenaeus’s main responses came from logic and Scriptures. He employed logic to point out that two contrasting gods, being inevitably imperfect and limited, can hardly be called gods. His abundant use of Scriptures (629 citations from both the Old Testament and 1,065 from the New) is impressive and unique among second-century writers, who relied largely on logic or—as in the case of Justin Martyr—on primarily Old Testament writings. It was for Irenaeus a careful and deliberate choice, in order to confirm the apostolic truth the Gnostics refuted. His inclusion of New Testament Scriptures is particularly useful to historians as a proof that many of the books that compose this part of the Bible were already authoritative at that time.* - [Christian History](https://www.christianitytoday.com/history/people/evangelistsandapologists/irenaeus-gnosticism-gaul-erasmus-persecution.html)

**Recapitulation**

*He has therefore, in His work of recapitulation, summed up all things, both waging war against our enemy, and crushing him who had at the beginning led us away captives in Adam, and trampled upon his head, as you can perceive in Genesis that God said to the serpent, “And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; He shall be on the watch for your head, and you on the watch for His heel.” For from that time, He who should be born of a woman, [namely] from the Virgin, after the likeness of Adam, was preached as keeping watch for the head of the serpent. This is the seed of which the apostle says in the Epistle to the Galatians, “that the law of works was established until the seed should come to whom the promise was made.” This fact is exhibited in a still clearer light in the same Epistle, where he thus speaks: “But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman.” For indeed the enemy would not have been fairly vanquished, unless it had been a man [born] of a woman who conquered him. For it was by means of a woman that he got the advantage over man at first, setting himself up as man’s opponent. And therefore does the Lord profess Himself to be the Son of man, comprising in Himself that original man out of whom the woman was fashioned, in order that, as our species went down to death through a vanquished man, so we may ascend to life again through a victorious one; and as through a man death received the palm [of victory] against us, so again by a man we may receive the palm against death. - [Irenaeus]*(https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103521.htm)
