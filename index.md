 - His father was a leader in the church.
 - He was raised in the apostolic faith

**PAUL WAS HIS BOY**

*Paul's refusal to allow any element of law-keeping in the message of salvation was taken by Marcion to imply that not only the Old Testament law, but the Old Testament itself, had been superseded by the gospel.* - F.F Bruce

 - He not only rejected the OT, but rejected the God of the O.T as well.
 - In his mind Christ's Father was completely incompatible with the God of the O.T
 - He tried to reach out to Polycarp to teach him the truth but was rejected.

**SO HE GOES TO ROME TO REACH OUT TO THOSE WHO ARE EDUCATED**

- He makes a large donation to the church of Rome
- The leaders there, when hearing Marcion's Gospel, return his money and reject his message.

*Enlightened and unprejudiced the church leaders in Rome might be, yet they understandably found this teaching unacceptable, so Marcion, despairing of being able to convince the catholic church anywhere of the truth of his message, withdrew from the catholic fellowship and established a church of his own. This church survived for several generations - surprisingly, when it is considered that its membership was maintained solely through conversion. It could not keep its numbers up by incorporating the children of existing members, for celibacy was obligatory on all its membership. At the same time, Marcion was a faithful enough Paulinist to allow no discrimination against female members of his church in matters of privilege or function: for him, as for Paul, there was 'neither male nor female' (Gal, 3:28)* - F.F Bruce
